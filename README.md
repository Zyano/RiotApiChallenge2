Brainstorm Ideas:
Utilize pro player item build for automatic setup of new item sets.
Allow users to upload and share (download) item sets (perhaps along with guides?) - could be with an optional installer(?)

Check recent games with user specified champions, to create item sets based on previous matches (allow customization, in form of: high win rate, high KDA, only ranked, only normal etc.).
(Do the same as above, for ranked players to copy "good" builds?)

Web Design:

Notes (from comments):
Your project should be judge-able without any content that needs to be downloaded and installed/run. Any web-based project should be fine. We're not trying to avoid browser plugins like Adobe Flash, but we are trying to avoid Java applications that need to be downloaded and installed/run on the user's machine.

If you're making a website that offers a custom desktop background or custom item sets, that's fine. Basically assume you're on the computer that is carrying your final project for the semester. You probably don't want to download and install something that might smoke your computer. Consider your users. If you're offering item sets to download, consider making a version that is copy/paste-able for those that want to be more cautious.

This is an area that will left up to our discretion. If you aren't sure about your specific use-case then create a submission and ask in an App Note.
