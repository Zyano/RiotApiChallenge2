Brainstorm Ideas:
Utilize pro player item build for automatic setup of new item sets.
Allow users to upload and share (download) item sets (perhaps along with guides?) - could be with an optional installer(?)

Check recent games with user specified champions, to create item sets based on previous matches (allow customization, in form of: high win rate, high KDA, only ranked, only normal etc.).
(Do the same as above, for ranked players to copy "good" builds?)

Web Design:
Bootstrap
